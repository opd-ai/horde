## Support the Project

If you find this project useful, you should probably support Stable Horde by contributing hardware, time, or support.
Seriously, this is a very basic effort that I'm using on a temporary basis until I can do the generation on my own hardware.
Support Stable Horde instead, if you can.

If you don't have the ability to support Stable Horde but do have crypto, consider supporting the developer of this library:
